<h2>Limaki.Graphics 0.064</h2>
<p>Limaki.Graphics is a graph visualization library.</p>
<p>The library provides</p> 
* Basic data structures to represent graphs, nodes and links. A graph consists of nodes and links (or vertices and edges, if you like).<br>
* A graphical editor to add, edit and remove links and nodes of a graph<br>
* Support of links on links<br>
* DragDrop of string data<br>
* Tree-Layout<br>
<p><b>Why another graph-library?</b></p>
Until now, there is no open source graph visualization library in c# which supports the concept of links on links. Links on Links means that a link can connect not only nodes, but other links too: a link acts as a node.<br> 
This release is a proof of concept; the main purpose was to find out an architecture which provides a user-friendly graphical interface to manipulate graph structures.<br> 
This is a pre-alpha-release.<br>
<p>The software is tested on Net 2.0, Mono 2.0 (Build 109366) under Windows XP and Mono 2.0 (Build 109366) under Suse Linux 10.3.<br>
<p><b>Known limitations of this release:</b></p>
Editing works only on string-based widgets.<br>
DragDrop works only on string-based widgets.<br>
The graphical representation is limited to simple rectangles and lines.<br>
There is no design-time support; you have to code everything “by hand”.<br>
Mono:<br>
Although I tried my best to provide the full feature set on mono, you have to consider the following limitations when using it under mono:
<br>
Speed: around 1/3 of speed under mono-windows, less on mono-linux<br>
Cursor-Handling: the cursors don’t show up as in .NET if you manipulate nodes (resizing, moving)<br>
No DragDrop-support
<p><b>New features since Version 0.063:</b></p>
* Multi-Selection<br> 
* enhanced speed with bigger graphs<br>
* port of Net Topology Suite's QuadTree to work with System.Drawing PointF, RectangleF<br>
